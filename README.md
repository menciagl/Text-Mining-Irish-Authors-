# IRISH AUTHORS OF THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

In this final project for the course Text Mining, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the most representative novels by prominent Irish authors from the 19th and 20th centuries, including both male and female voices. Our goal is to **compare linguistic and thematic trends**, focusing on how **shared historical, cultural, and geographic contexts may shape their writing.**

The project centers around the following novels:

Oscar Wilde – The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890)

Bram Stoker – Dracula (1897)

James Joyce – Ulysses (1920)

Elizabeth Bowen – The Death of the Heart (1938)

Edna O’Brien – The Country Girls (1960)


Additionally, we analyze how Ireland itself is represented, both in terms of explicit references and the emotions associated with it. We are also interested in the role of gender and how women and femininity are portrayed in their works.

To carry out this analysis, we used **Text Mining techniques in R Studio**, like **analysis of term / n-grams ferquency, TF-IDF, correlations, sparsity, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, ABSA, etc.**

To run the code you must download the attached .Rmd as well as the texts in .txt or .pdf format.
